# Imperative Haskell Algorithms

Research project to create several imperative data structures and algorithms for
Haskell using the IO monad.  The project was successful, but several tries to
build applications around this library resulted in very high memory use and poor
performance (resulting from excessive GC usage).  It is possible that it was the
fault of the applications, not the library itself, but the project was abandoned
anyway.
