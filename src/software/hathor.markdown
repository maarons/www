# Hathor

Hathor allows you tracking of your favourite TV series (TV shows).  It can show
you what episodes will soon be available and what episodes already are there,
but you have not seen them yet.

Hathor gets all information about TV series from Wikipedia.  If there is a list
of episodes for you your favourite show on Wikipedia and it is using the
“Episode list” template you are probably good to go.  If there is not such a
list, make one — let everyone else benefit!

# Possible problems

There is no standard for writing lists of episodes on Wikipedia, for example
some use the “Start date” template to mark episode’s release date, but others
use the “Dts” template.  Some shows use “Season x” section titles, others use
“Series x” titles, and so on.  Hathor’s parser makes the best effort to parse
most popular TV series data, hoping that others will be written similarly.  If
it does not parse your favourite show, and the article is written as shit
(differently than anything else on Wikipedia) rewrite it to match other more
popular articles, if the article is not the thing to blame let me know about the
problem.
