title: Marek Sapota — Sintel

# Sintel

Sintel is a VoIP software that is currently badly broken — the interface is bad,
audio gets desynchronised and may have other issues that I do not remember.
Sintel never worked very well but with each attempt to make it better it got
more complicated and bloated, bringing it to the current state.  I have
abandoned this project and I do not have any interest in fixing it.
