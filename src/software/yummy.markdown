# Yummy

My bachelor’s thesis (in Computer Science) project.  Research project to deliver
an application that can fetch and process data from MediaWiki powered sites
entirely on the client site using JavaScript.  This way the application could
utilise client’s bandwidth and CPU power, not the server's.  The project was
successful and is now abandoned.
