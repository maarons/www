title: Marek Sapota — Yummy

# Yummy

My bachelor’s thesis in Computer Science project.  Yummy was created by me along
with Michał Kijewski, Marek Kiszkis and Oskar Wantoła.  The thesis itself is
available [online](/thesis.html).

Yummy was a research project to deliver a web application that can fetch and
process data from MediaWiki powered sites entirely on the client site using
JavaScript.  This way the application could utilise client’s bandwidth and CPU
power, not the server’s.  The project was successful and is now abandoned.
