# Mozilla Ubiquity Commands

I created an alternative Google search command and a command for searching
OpenStreetMap.  As the Ubiquity project has been more or less abandoned and each
new version broke something in my commands without a warning I abandoned the
project.  Code is still available if someone wants to see it for some reason.

OpenStreetMap search functionality has evolved into the [OSM browser
extension](/software/osm_extension.html).
