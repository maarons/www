# About me

I am a software engineer, currently employed by Facebook, Inc.  I am especially
interested in web applications, functional programming and utilities that can
automate common tasks and make my life easier.

I hold a master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Warsaw.
Both my bachelor’s thesis and master’s thesis are available
[online](/thesis.html).

I am a free software enthusiast, I believe users should be able to use their
computers however they want to, not how software/hardware vendors let them.  In
this spirit I release all my software under libre licenses, you can find some my
creations in the [software](/software.html) section.

# Work

Since 2012 I am employed by Facebook, Inc.  Previously I have been an intern at
Facebook, Inc. in 2011 (Open Source team), Opera Software ASA in 2011 (Core QA
team) and the Free Software Foundation in 2009.

# About this web page

You should be able to comfortably browse this page with almost any browser, but
since I am a software engineer and a web freak, I have used some cool HTML/CSS
features that might not be supported in older browsers.  Not to worry though,
legacy browsers should gracefully degrade and produce a working web page.

This web page is generated from templates using [Hakyll][hakyll].  If you want
to see how it is done the sources are available on [Github][www].  Feel free to
get some inspiration from them and/or adapt them for your own needs.
