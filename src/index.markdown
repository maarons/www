# About me

I am a software engineer, currently employed by Facebook, Inc.  I’m especially
interested in web applications, functional programming and utilities that can
automate common tasks and make my life easier.

I hold a master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Warsaw.  Both my Bachelor’s thesis and Master’s thesis are available
[online](/thesis.html).

I am a free software enthusiast, I believe users should be able to use their
computers however they want to, not how software/hardware vendors let them.  In
this spirit I release all my software under libre licenses, you can find some my
creations in the [software](/software.html) section.

# Work

Since 2012 I’m employed by Facebook, Inc.  Previously I’ve been an intern at
Facebook, Inc. in 2011 (Open Source team), Opera Software ASA in 2011 (Core QA
team) and the Free Software Foundation in 2009.

# About this web page

You should be able to comfortably browse this page with almost any browser, but
since I’m a software engineer and a web freak, I’ve used some cool HTML/CSS
features that might not be supported in older browsers.  Not to worry though,
legacy browsers should gracefully degrade and produce a working web page.

This web page is generated from templates using
[Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/index.html).  If you want to see how it’s
done the sources are available on [Github](https://github.com/maarons/www).
Feel free to get some inspiration from them and/or adapt them for your own
needs.
